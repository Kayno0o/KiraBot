# Presentation
KiraBot is the bot I always dreamt to code...\
I really want to put effort on it (or maybe I will give up as always, we'll see...)

I want it to be a multi-purpose bot.\
And by that, I mean **multi-purpose**.

Weather, maths, random fact, moderation, gifs, horoscope, anime, ...

And yes... I know a lot of bots already do that, but I wanna do it in my own way. ;)

Feel free to send me suggestions on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/v3gWmCrvNf)
